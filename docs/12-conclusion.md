#### Conclusion

 Blockchain and DLTs have the potential to transform and greatly improve the property transaction process, reducing the transaction time down to days. The Land Registry is a crucial party to this process because of its database of 24 million property records.

 The database and the operations on it could be performed and stored on the blockchain. The blockchain technologies that could do this are the largest Open Source Software projects by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum.

 A property can be bought with bitcoin, digital cash, in exchange for the transfer of ownership details handled by Ethereum's smart contracts, the exchange recorded on the blockchain, secure, and free from alteration.

 The basic setup of the blockchain technologies would involve a change in the form AP1 to get the first instance of a property on the blockchain, and a multi-sig smart contract to maintain control over ownership between the owner, financial intermediary and a solicitor.

 The total time to transfer to blockchain at the natural rate of conversion would take a minimum of 24.5 years. The real property can be tansferred one at a time. Mass transfer or network effects are not necessary. The Land Registry would still need to processs the updated version of the AP1 form during this time for each property transfer. Property records would still need to be administered, but subsequent ownership transfer would be performed on the blockchain. Smart contracts would have to be designed, coded and implemented.

 The use of Bitcoin and Ethereum does not imply loss of central control. The design mentioned here includes current parties who are still important to the process of buying and selling a real property. By design, public blockchains are transparent, but information can be stored in a hash, to protect personal information. Title deeds already can be accessed by anyone. Blockchain would help with proper taxation and machine learning could help with pricing property properly.

 Involved parties would interact with the blockchain through a decentralised app, called a Dapp. This would be just like using a website for the user. They would be identified by their account and the transaction could be done on a mobile phone or laptop.

 The property transaction process is complicated and so any solution addressing this process is going to be involved too. But the solution proposed above would include all current parties, whilst improving the real property transaction process.
