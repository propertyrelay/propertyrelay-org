#### Land Registry

 The purpose of the Land Registry is to maintain a register of ownership of land and property in England and Wales. The Land Registry has been through a lot of changes since it was formed in 1862. Inititally the registry was in the form of paper title deeds and plans. Subsequently records of titles were transferred onto a database, where over 24 million records are currently maintained. 

 There are two factors about the Land Registry that lends itself to the conversion to a blockchain model. The Land Registry:

  * maintains a register of land and property ownership in a database;
  * changes the state of the register in that database, representing transfer of ownership.
  These two factors, the storage of records in a database, and the transfer of ownership in this database, can be implemented using blockchain.
