#### Concerns

 There are many concerns with blockchain and DLT because of it's wide ranging reach and value storage and transfer. The two main concerns with open source blockchain technology that dominate discussion are security and scalability. Security refers to a number of areas, such as the underlying technology, the storage of accounts and addresses and issues with smart contracts. Scalability refers to the ability of the blockchains to handle increasing numbers of transactions. There are other concerns that arise out of the use of blockchain and DLTs, and control thereof.

  1. Underlying Technology: The central cores of both Bitcoin and Ethereum have been resiliant. The records in both of these blockchains are for all intents and purposes immutable, and records added cannot be changed. But the most recent transactions at any given time are susceptible to the 'double spend' problem while they are in the process of being verified. Ensuring that sufficent confirmations are processed reduces this issue. Other actions include halting transactions when there is a hard fork. And splitting up large transactions into smaller payments.


  2. Accounts/Addresses: Accounts and address security is very important. Issues in the news about theft have mainly been the result of inadequate handling and protection of the account's and address's information. The underlying technology is sound, but people may drop their laptop or spill coffee on their mobile phone. Proper redundency, backup and recovery is required.


  3. Issues with smart contracts: Ethereum smart contracts are written in programming languages, and therefore the robustness and operation of the smart contract is dependant on the quality of the code. The quality of the code in the smart contract and it's importance was highlighted by the Ethereum DAO attack in June 2016 in which an attempt to steal a considerable quantity of tokens took place. The attempted theft took advantage of a vulnerability in the smart contract code, but after much discussion a hard fork was implemented returning the tokens back to their rightful owners. There were discussions about whether a hard fork was the right thing to do.

  Solutions to contract issues include testing on the blockchain's testnet, peer review and incentives through bounties. The Land Registry has a good reputation, including a customer satisfaction score of 94%, so developers may be happy to assist in testing. And if the transfer is done at the natural rate it can be tested on one property at a time. Contracts can test for whether the sale is to and from a registered/verified solicitor address/account. Also control could be reverted back to the Land Registry through a smart contract and multi-sig account if something goes wrong.


  4. Scalability: Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are undergoing extensive discussion and rapid development regarding scalability. Ethereum's current release is called Homestead, and has a timeline for further scalability[[27]](14-references.md) enhancements over the next number of years called Metropolis and Serenity. Bitcoin is currently testing Segregated Witness, to prevent malleability weakness and in preparation for the possible introduction of the Lightning Network that will allow substantially larger volumes and size of transactions.


  5. Substantial value transfer: Both sides include substantial value transfer and just one mistake, for example the theft or wrong routing of bitcoin or ether could be substantial. Blockchain transactions are irreversible. As mentioned above, the core technology is not the issue. A rigorous system design and extensive testing is needed, but the proposal presented here has tried to minimise the failure of the system.


  6. Cryptocurrency's reputation: There has been a lot of press coverage on cryptocurrency since its introduction in 2009, culminating in the front page coverage of the theft of a substantial quantity of bitcoin from Mt. Gox in 2013. The vulnerability was the Bitcoin exchange, not the underlying Bitcoin technology, although this has been argued. The fix is called Segregated Witness. Blockchain and DLTs are a new technology and are undergoing the same growing pains the early Internet did in the 1990s. "A common misconception about Bitcoin is that it is not regulated."[[28]](docs/14-references.md) The image is that Bitcoin is dangerous because it is uncontrollable. But this is not the whole story. Bitcoin is regulated and government, regulatory bodies and the law is quickly catching up to understand and put in place a framework that will allow it to work in a manner similar to the Internet.


  7. Permission or Permissionless: The argument presented here has been for the use of Bitcoin and Ethereum by the Land Registry, both of which are examples of permissionless based blockchain technologies, i.e. independent of a trusted party. However as outlined above, consideration has been given to the level of control exercised by the parties involved in the real property transaction, for example the measured transfer of real properties to the blockchain and the use of multi-sig accounts for financial intermediaries, solicitors and buyers and sellers.


  8. Public or Private blockchain: Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of public blockchains. They are both Open Source Software projects. One advantage of this is that both have already been developed and are operational. Use of these would save on development costs. There has been a move by Government to shift to OSS. The Land Registry already offers access to title deeds of real property so property information being public on the blockchain is not of as a big step.


  9. Exchanging fiat: Both costs and account set up are and could be expensive and time consuming. Sending a bitcoin payment is cheap, but converting from fiat currency to bitcoin is more complicated at the moment. Setting up the bitcoin account takes time as digital asset exchange companies are required to undertake Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) checks. In addition, the current source of the large amount of fiat currency required for the purpose of buying the majority of real properties is a financial intermediary.


  10. Social Engineering (Security): Blockchain technologies make the real property transaction simpler, quicker and easier with transactions taking place using a Dapp. Although it is designed with the buyer and seller in mind the human factor needs careful consideration. Impulse purchases and sales, coersion and password and account information extraction have human elements. Also the anonymity of accounts and one way nature of the payment transactions are factors. The multi-sig account, and the role of its arbitor, reversion of a real property to the Land Registry, and maybe cooling off periods, provide the main protection to some of these elements but systems need deisgning to accomodate these factors.


  11. Financial Intermediaries Capital Requirements (a run on a bank): The way the financing system around the real property transaction process is designed is very important. If, for example, one financial intermediary supplied 'all' of the financing for one property chain the net actual financing would be comparitively very small compared to the total value of all the real properties on the property chain. Another case could be that if different financial intermediaries with many real property loans they may obtain financing through a daily bridge loan in the expectation of the stastical assessment that there will always be homes bought and sold in its 'portfolio', but this could be greatly strained if the norm varies.


  12. Quantum computing: The whole DLT system is secured on cryptography. One of quantum computers main use is to break cryptographic algorithms. Accounts and addresses could be compromised and the contents spent or transferred bacause of this. There have been articles about solutions to this problem but this is relatively new.
