#### Summary

 "Distributed ledger technology has the potential to transform the delivery of public and private services."[[1]](docs/14-references.md) Blockchain, which is a part of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), has been referred to as "...the Internet of value." [[2]](docs/14-references.md) DLT is being analysed by many different organisations at home and abroad for use for many different applications involving value. The UK Government's Chief Scientist has issued a report about the technology.[[3]](docs/14-references.md) Sweden's Land Registry is investigating: 'Sweden conducts trials of a blockchain smart contracts technology for land registry' [[4]](docs/14-references.md) and 'Estonia has an electronic land registry...reducing land transfers from three months to a little over a week.'[[5]](docs/14-references.md)

 These various organisations are looking at different forms of Distributed Ledger Technology. Both private and public DLTs are being investigated, however there is a move to use Open Source Software(OSS) that is the basis for public DLTs. OSS "...provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose."[[6]](docs/14-references.md) The United States government is making guidelines for its agencies regarding OSS. A memo was released on 8th August 2016 by Tony Scott, Whitehouse CIO, about open sourcing at least 20% of government agency's software[[7]](docs/14-references.md). The two leading OSS blockchain technologies by market capitalisation are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

 The functions of the Land Registry - the register and transfer of real property ownership details in a database - can be performed on Ethereum's blockchain. Combined with Bitcoin, which is digital cash, the entire real property transaction process can be performed using these blockchain technologies simplifying the process and reducing transaction times substantially.

 The database maintained by the Land Registry is one of the largest property databases in Europe, containing over 24 million land and real property records representing significant value. The proposal here suggests transferring the records to the blockchain in a measured way. Every time the Land Registry recieves a completed AP1 form - a request for change of ownership - the property concerned would be put on the blockchain.

 At the rate currently processed by the Land Registry approximately one million properties would be put on the blockchain per year. If this 'natural rate' was implemented it would take about 24.5 years to transfer all the registered real property to the blockchain. Although this timeline could be speeded up or slowed down as desired.

 The Land Registry would still be able to charge for the one-time transfer of the property from the in-house database to the blockchain until the transfer of all records is complete. Charges would be collected automatically specified in computer code and paid in digital cash, which could then be converted to fiat money if desired. Taxes could be collected at source in the same way, greatly improving on the current processes.

 Bitcoin and Ethereum have already been designed and developed, the use of which would reduce resouce consumption and developement time of a blockchain solution from scratch. The use of these technologies ultimately would transform and greatly improve the real property transaction process for the Land Registry, Government and buyers and sellers.
