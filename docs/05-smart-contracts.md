Smart contracts
"Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary. Smart contracts usually also have a user interface and often emulate the logic of contractual clauses."
[13]
The DLT that automates the transfer of ownership of the real property and the storage of the owners details on the blockchain - the sellers side of the real property tranaction - is handled by smart contracts.  This automated transfer of ownership is triggered by the fullfillment of the requirement specified by the owner in the smart contract.  i.e. the payment of the sale price of the real property, in bitcoins or Ethereums currency, ether.
The function of a smart contract is best explained with a comparison between how an online transaction may take place, in Diagram 1, and how the process of a smart contract would be applied to this same transaction process, in Diagram 2.  Diagram 2 is a hypothectical process that contains a hypothectical entity called an Automated Independent Distribution Centre (AIDR) that executes functions based on the actions of the parties involved. Basically this AIDR ensures that if the seller recieves the payment the item is automatically delivered to the buyer, whoever that is.


Analogy of operation of a Smart Contract - the Automated Independent Distribution Centre (AIDR)

Diagram 1: Current transaction process
Seller offers item for sale online
Buyer accepts and sends payment to seller
Seller delivers item to seller


Diagram 2: Hypothetical AIDR process
Seller offers item for sale online
Seller sends item to AIDR
Buyer accepts and sends payment to seller
AIDR gets payment notification
AIDR delivers item to seller



The Consumer Rights Act 2015[14] makes it the legal obligation of the seller to deliver the item to the buyer.  What the smart contract, the AIDR, does in this case is facilitate and enforce this obligation once the payment is received by the seller.
The process of selling something with nominal value probably doesn't need the added processes introduced in Diagram 2, but exchanging things of considerable and significant value, this escrow-type service would provide security to both the seller and buyer.  In particular, the Automated Independent Distribution Centre only releases the item when the seller recieves the payment.
Real property has considerable and significant value, and because of the design of the blockchain, digital cash and smart contracts, the process similar to that shown in Diagram 2 can be translated to a real property transaction.  Instead of transferring a physical item, the smart contract transfers and stores the new ownership details of the real property in exchange for payment, all done on the blockchain, reducing the process down to days.  The Open Source Software (OSS) DLT that has the second highest market cap to Bitcoin, and implements smart contacts, is Ethereum.
