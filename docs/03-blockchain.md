#### Blockchain

 "A blockchain - originally, block chain - is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of data records called blocks secured from tampering and revision. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block."[[8]](14-references.md)

 The key function of the blockchain is to enable peer-to-peer transactions of value or data representing value. The blockchain has special attributes, based around a distributed database. In relation to the blockchain, a distributed database is many databases on many nodes, all containing the same data, forming a network. A node is an individual computer, and a network is many computers linked to one another.

 Currently an electonic financial transaction requires a trusted intermediary to verify the transaction between two parties, such as a bank making a record of a transaction in a bank account on a centralised database. Blockchain is 'trustless' meaning that transactions can be between two parties without a trusted intermediary. This is because the blockchain verifies the transaction in place of that intermediary. Therefore property ownership details and digital monetary value can be exchanged, and stored securely, on the blockchain. 

 Every database in this network has records added to it, called blocks, in a "linear, chronological order"[[9]](14-references.md) and timestamped, linking the previous blocks to one another in a chain, which once added are immutable due to a "'trustless' proof mechanism"[[10]](14-references.md). These blocks consist of transactions sent between users of the blockchain. Only consensus between nodes on the network determine whether a transaction is legitimate or not. The first instance of the transaction, as denoted by the timestamp, is considered the legitimate one. All other instances of that transaction are rejected by the network, preventing the 'double spend' problem.

 Consensus is performed by 'miners', who verify the blocks as they are created and added to the blockchain. In exchange for this service they recieve a fee. This fee is the digital cash, the currency, of the blockchain. This currency can be transacted on the blockchain and can be used as payment in exchange for the transfer of property ownership on the blockchain.

 The ownership details of the buyer can be added to the blockchain in place of the seller's details in exchange for the digital currency. A record of both sides of this transaction is stored on the blockchain. Once the record is on the blockchain it cannot be changed. This model means that the blockchain removes the need for proceses like exchange of contracts. 

 The above described blockchain model is that of the first blockchain based technology, called Bitcoin. There have been further developments of, and variations on, this model including those of Distributed Ledger Technologies.

 The two blockchain based technologies referred to below, for the purposes of transferring property ownership details in exchange for digital cash, are Bitcoin and Ethereum. In it's initial incarnation, introduced in 2008, blockchain referred to a growing database of electronic cash transactions, called Bitcoin.
