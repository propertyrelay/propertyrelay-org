<H2>Property Relay</H2>
  
<p>Welcome to propertyrelay.org, aiming to facilitate transactions between the physical and digital world by using the blockchain, smart contracts and Dapps technology.</p>
<H4>Introduction</H4>
<p>Property Relay is a hat tip to <a href="http://www.btcrelay.org" target="_blank">BTC Relay</a> and aims to enable the peer-to-peer (P2P) sale of property on the blockchain by doing two things centred around <a href="https://www.ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>'s global computer:
<ul>
 <li> provide a resource for the desciption of physical property, initally privately owned real estate;</li>
 <li> provide a relay between this resource and smart contracts;</li>
</ul></p>
<p>In a real world transaction there is a buyer and a seller whose tranaction is governed by a contract, whether written or verbal.  In the digital world, with the advent of Ethereum and smart contracts the tranaction and transfer of ownership can be automated.  Below is a diagram flow of this new process:</p>

<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow1">Seller writes smart contract for the sale of property and posts it and their bitcoin address on Ethereum</div>

<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow4">Ethereum contract executes registering the buyers new ownership of the property</div>
</div>
</div>
<H4>Raison d'etre</H4>

<p>At the moment the sale of real estate takes 2 to 3 months.  Ethereum's smart contracts and other compliamentary technologies, such as <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>, could reduce this time substantially, but the physical asset, the real estate, or physical property, still requires checks on both the buyers side, including personal identity verification, and the sellers side, including property searches and surveys, before the sale completes.</p>

<H4>The solution</H4>

<p>What if there was a resource on the web that contained all the required documentation describing the physical property: pictures; descriptions; age; surveys; and energy reports; that could be used to expidite the sale of a property?  In addition what if there was a way to assosiate the buyer with a bitcoin address?</p>

<p>A Decentralised Application (Dapp), would enable the P2P sale of property.  It would contain a traffic light system, like RICS Conditon Report, and checklist to show the state of the description of each physical property.  For example:</p>
<ul>
 <li>the age of the property;</li>
 <li>condition of property;</li>
 <li>floor plan;</li>
 <li>features;</li>
 <li>no of rooms;</li>
 <li>sq. feet area;</li>
 <li>issues;</li>
 <li>selling history; </li>
 <li>price history;</li>
 <li>list of repairs;</li>
 <li>list of improvements;</li>
 <li>accreditations of tradesmen;</li>
 <li>previous surveys (e.g. by bank for mortgage);</li>
 <li>surveyor history;</li>
 <li>flood risk;</li>
 <li>Energy Performance Certificate (EPC);</li>
 <li>energy usage;</li>
 <li>local searches;</li>
 <li>guarantees.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the buyers side, once the buyer is verified and linked to a bitcoin address that is registered on the title deed, there would be no need to verify the next buyer.  The buyer would only need to send the cost of the physical property to the bitcoin address registered on the title deed, which is immutable on the blockchain.  BTC Relay would then confirm the bitcoin tranfer and add the new owner to the title deed Ethereum contract.</p>

<p>This desciption of the physical property would be the first step in the property sales process on the blockchain.  The process would be:</p>
<ul>
 <li>check property description;</li>
 <li>exchange contracts;</li>
 <li>completion, including payment in full and title deed updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitcoin could be used as the purchase currency and the Ethereum contract could register the new owner on the title deed along with the bitcoin address.  Once this initial registration and buyer personal identity verification is done subsequent sales of that property would be much faster because the property description is available on the blockchain along with the owners name and bitcoin address.  This is the major advantage of PropertyRelay Dapp over the current state.</p>
<H4>Issues with solution</H4>

<p>A related system was introduced by the UK governement in 2007, called the Home Information Pack (HIP).  The HIP required home sellers to provide some of the information mentioned in the list above.  This scheme was suspended in 2010. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Information_Pack" target="_blank">Wiki</a>)  This system however was compulsory.  It pushed the seller.  PropertyRelay pulls the seller instead as it can be seen to offer a clear advantage over the existing system, when combined with Ethereum's blockchain technology and Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Home owners may be reluctant to provide certain information, for example previous purchase price and flood risk.  The collection of large amounts of data poses scaling issues.  However, the data gained from users could be used for Big Data purposes, offering further insight into each property and the property market.  For example an internal issue such as relating the fitting of a new kitchen to an increase in the purchase price.  Or an external issue like a new school.  There are 25 million households in the UK so the conversion of this could be slow, however, once a property is described on the blockchain the information is available for each subsequent sale of that property.  Also the Dapp can start out with just one sale and purchase. It doesn't need a network effect.</p>

<H4>Competitors</H4>

<p>Property Relay is a fairly new concept but there are traditional companies in this space who would compete and could be disrupted.  Solicitors, Estate Agents and property search websites are in this space.  Property rental websites also could be affected.</p>

<H4>Ethereum Issues</H4>

<p>Another issue is that unlike Bitcoin, which can be seen as a limited liability company where you can only lose what you invest, with Ethereum, it's smart contracts represent considerably larger values than the cost of the contract or the value of Ether (Ethereums currency).  This means that ample checks need to be made as the transaction cannot be reversed in the tradtional sense.  The legal position of its contracts have yet to be established. (April 2016)</p>
