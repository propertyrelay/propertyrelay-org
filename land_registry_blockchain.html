<h4 id="h4_0">Summary</h4>

<p>"Distributed ledger technology has the potential to transform the delivery of public and private services."<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>  Blockchain, which is a part of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), has been referred to as "...the Internet of value." <a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>  DLT is being analysed by many different organisations at home and abroad for use for many different applications involving value.  The UK Government's Chief Scientist has issued a report about the technology.<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>  Sweden's Land Registry is investigating: 'Sweden conducts trials of a blockchain smart contracts technology for land registry' <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and 'Estonia has an electronic land registry...reducing land transfers from three months to a little over a week.'<a href="#5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>  

<p>These various organisations are looking at different forms of Distributed Ledger Technology.  Both private and public DLTs are being investigated, however there is a move to use Open Source Software(OSS) that is the basis for public DLTs.  OSS "...provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose."<a href="#6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>  The United States government is making guidelines for its agencies regarding OSS.  A memo was released on 8th August 2016 by Tony Scott, Whitehouse CIO, about open sourcing at least 20% of government agency's software<a href="#7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.  The two leading OSS blockchain technologies by market capitalisation are Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>

<p>The functions of the Land Registry - the register and transfer of real property ownership details in a database - can be performed on Ethereum's blockchain.  Combined with Bitcoin, which is digital cash, the entire real property transaction process can be performed using these blockchain technologies simplifying the process and reducing transaction times substantially.</p> 

<p>The database maintained by the Land Registry is one of the largest property databases in Europe, containing over 24 million land and real property records representing significant value.  The proposal here suggests transferring the records to the blockchain in a measured way.  Every time the Land Registry recieves a completed AP1 form - a request for change of ownership - the property concerned would be put on the blockchain.</p>

<p>At the rate currently processed by the Land Registry approximately one million properties would be put on the blockchain per year.  If this 'natural rate' was implemented it would take about 24.5 years to transfer all the registered real property to the blockchain.  Although this timeline could be speeded up or slowed down as desired.</p>

<p>The Land Registry would still be able to charge for the one-time transfer of the property from the in-house database to the blockchain until the transfer of all records is complete. Charges would be collected automatically specified in computer code and paid in digital cash, which could then be converted to fiat money if desired.  Taxes could be collected at source in the same way, greatly improving on the current processes.</p>  

<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum have already been designed and developed, the use of which would reduce resouce consumption and developement time of a blockchain solution from scratch.  The use of these technologies ultimately would transform and greatly improve the real property transaction process for the Land Registry, Government and buyers and sellers.</p>

<h4 id="h4_1">Introduction</h4>

<p>The <a href="#h4_3">Blockchain</a> is a distributed database with special technological attributes that have the potential to transform and greatly improve the real property transaction ecosystem.  The Land Registry's task of storing and transferring ownership details can be performed on the blockchain.  Blockchain can automate the registration process and with it the whole real property transaction process.  The blockchain-based technology that can significantly improve the transfer of ownership of real property is called a <a href="#h4_5">smart contract.</a></p>

<p>At the moment the real property transaction process - the sale of a property -  typically is a long process, taking about 3 months on average.  Improvements in the process have been made with advances in technology. For example the Land Registry offers the AP1 form and the use of electronic conveyancing and electronic signatures as introduced by the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Blockchain technologies change the dynamic of the relationships between the involved parties of the real property transaction.  It allows peer to peer transactions, with an altered role for the 3rd parties, also called intermediaries.  What this means for the Land Registry is that key parts of the land or property record would be stored in a smart contract on the blockchain, with a transformed and improved way of transferring ownership.  This arrangement could reduce the real property transaction time down to days, rather than months.</p>

<p>Property has significant value, it is governed by laws, and its transfer can be complicated.  This means that there are a number of parties involved in the transaction process.  In each transaction usually there is the buyer and seller, the Land Registry, solicitors, banks, estate agents and a surveyor.  The transaction process is varied based on the property and the circumstances of those involved in the process.  But many real property transactions involve operations and exceptions that have standardised, quick and/or formalised, responses.  This lends the real property process to automation using Blockchain-based and Information Technology.</p>

<p>For most of its history land and property registration with the Land Registry has been voluntary.  Now only when an unregistered property changes ownership is there a requirement to register the property. This same voluntary approach can be taken with Blockchain technology. Sellers can choose whether to use the Blockchain allowing a gradual transition.  However, the benefits and convenience of using this new technology, combined with ubiqutous access to technologies including computers and mobile phones that are connected to the Internet, will hopefully pull sellers onto the platform.  And once a property has been put on the blockchain, subsequent transactions involving that property should be a lot simpler and quicker.</p>

<p>The Land Registry income would come from charging a a fee for transferring the real property to the blockchain.  The fee would be specified in the transfer process, coded into the smart contract, and taken automatically in digital currency as part of the transaction process. The fee would be fully transparent, and could be updatable. Blockchain-based technology also could help automate and speed up the collection of taxes.</p>

<h4 id="h4_2">Land Registry</h4>

<p>The purpose of the Land Registry is to maintain a register of ownership of land and property in England and Wales.  The Land Registry has been through a lot of changes since it was formed in 1862.  Inititally the registry was in the form of paper title deeds and plans.  Subsequently records of titles were transferred onto a database, where over 24 million records are currently maintained. </p> 

<p>There are two factors about the Land Registry that lends itself to the conversion to a blockchain model.  The Land Registry:</p>
<ul>
	<li>maintains a register of land and property ownership in a database;</li>
	<li>changes the state of the register in that database, representing transfer of ownership.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two factors, the storage of records in a database, and the transfer of ownership in this database, can be implemented using blockchain.</p>

<h4 id="h4_3">Blockchain</h4>

<p>"A blockchain—originally, block chain—is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of data records called blocks secured from tampering and revision.  Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block."<a href="#8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p>The key function of the blockchain is to enable peer-to-peer transactions of value or data representing value.  The blockchain has special attributes, based around a distributed database.  In relation to the blockchain, a distributed database is many databases on many nodes, all containing the same data, forming a network.  A node is an individual computer, and a network is many computers linked to one another.</p>

<p>Currently an electonic financial transaction requires a trusted intermediary to verify the transaction between two parties, such as a bank making a record of a transaction  in a bank account on a centralised database.  Blockchain is 'trustless' meaning that transactions can be between two parties without a trusted intermediary.  This is because the blockchain verifies the transaction in place of that intermediary.  Therefore property ownership details and digital monetary value can be exchanged, and stored securely, on the blockchain. </p> 

<p>Every database in this network has records added to it, called blocks, in a "linear, chronological order"<a href="#9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> and timestamped, linking the previous blocks to one another in a chain, which once added are immutable due to a "'trustless' proof mechanism"<a href="#10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.  These blocks consist of transactions sent between users of the blockchain.  Only consensus between nodes on the network determine whether a transaction is legitimate or not.  The first instance of the transaction, as denoted by the timestamp, is considered the legitimate one.  All other instances of that transaction are rejected by the network, preventing the 'double spend' problem.</p>

<p>Consensus is performed by 'miners', who verify the blocks as they are created and added to the blockchain.  In exchange for this service they recieve a fee.  This fee is the digital cash, the currency, of the blockchain.  This currency can be transacted on the blockchain and can be used as payment in exchange for the transfer of property ownership on the blockchain.</p> 

<p>The ownership details of the buyer can be added to the blockchain in place of the seller's details in exchange for the digital currency. A record of both sides of this transaction is stored on the blockchain.  Once the record is on the blockchain it cannot be changed.  This model means that the blockchain removes the need for proceses like exchange of contracts.  </p>

<p>The above described blockchain model is that of the first blockchain based technology, called Bitcoin.  There have been further developments of, and variations on, this model including those of Distributed Ledger Technologies.</p>

<p>The two blockchain based technologies referred to below, for the purposes of transferring property ownership details in exchange for digital cash, are Bitcoin and Ethereum.  In it's initial incarnation, introduced in 2008, blockchain referred to a growing database of electronic cash transactions, called Bitcoin.</p> 

<h4 id="h4_4">Bitcoin</h4

<p>"Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system."<a href="#11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> "...and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain, which uses bitcoin as its unit of account. "<a href="#12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p>Bitcoin is digital cash and within the context of a real property transaction can be seen as the payment from buyer to seller.  Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency which means that it is based on cryptography to secure the system and verify payments.  The advantages of using this mechanism is that it's secure, quick, incurs low fees, and is transparent.  It also means that it can be used with other Distributed Ledger Technologies.</p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions confirm on average in 10 minutes, but depends on the network, and will vary with the amount of fee paid.  A confirmation is similar in nature to clearing in a bank.  The greater the number of confirmations the greater the permanence of the transaction. As the payments for real property are significant value 6 confirmations or more is advisable. Transaction fees are very low at the moment.  Well under a £1 per transaction.  Transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, meaning they can be seen by anyone.  But the owners of the addresses that hold, receive or send Bitcoin are anonymous.  A bitcoin address is a bit like an email address, but instead transactions are sent to and from the address.</p>

<p>Because of the way Bitcoin and blockchains are designed they can interact with other DLTs.  With the digital cash payment recorded in the database, which is immutable and timestamped, this bitcoin payment information can be verified and used by the DLT that enables automation of the real property transaction, called a smart contract.</p>

<h4 id="h4_5">Smart contracts</h4>

<p>"Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary. Smart contracts usually also have a user interface and often emulate the logic of contractual clauses."
<a href="#13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p>The DLT that automates the transfer of ownership of the real property and the storage of the owners details on the blockchain - the sellers side of the real property tranaction - is handled by smart contracts.  This automated transfer of ownership is triggered by the fullfillment of the requirement specified by the owner in the smart contract.  i.e. the payment of the sale price of the real property, in bitcoins or Ethereums currency, ether.</p>

<p>The function of a smart contract is best explained with a comparison between how an online transaction may take place, in Diagram 1, and how the process of a smart contract would be applied to this same transaction process, in Diagram 2.  Diagram 2 is a hypothectical process that contains a hypothectical entity called an Automated Independent Distribution Centre (AIDR) that executes functions based on the actions of the parties involved. Basically this AIDR ensures that if the seller recieves the payment the item is automatically delivered to the buyer, whoever that is.</p>

	</div>
	
</div>

<p>The Consumer Rights Act 2015<a href="#14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> makes it the legal obligation of the seller to deliver the item to the buyer.  What the smart contract, the AIDR, does in this case is facilitate and enforce this obligation once the payment is received by the seller.</p>

<p>The process of selling something with nominal value probably doesn't need the added processes introduced in Diagram 2, but exchanging things of considerable and significant value, this escrow-type service would provide security to both the seller and buyer.  In particular, the Automated Independent Distribution Centre only releases the item when the seller recieves the payment.</p>

<p>Real property has considerable and significant value, and because of the design of the blockchain, digital cash and smart contracts, the process similar to that shown in Diagram 2 can be translated to a real property transaction.  Instead of transferring a physical item, the smart contract transfers and stores the new ownership details of the real property in exchange for payment, all done on the blockchain, reducing the process down to days.  The Open Source Software (OSS) DLT that has the second highest market cap to Bitcoin, and implements smart contacts, is Ethereum.

<h4 id="h4_6">Ethereum</h4>

<p>"Ethereum is a public blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency called ether."<a href="#15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p>Ethereum implements smart contracts.  In the context of the a real property transaction, in exchange for a payment in bitcoin or ether to the seller of the real property, the smart contract transfers ownership from the seller to the buyer, and stores this information on the blockchain.</p>

<p>There are two possible uses of DLTs that are presented below. The first is to use Ethereum's smart contracts as the ownership transfer mechanism combined with bitcoin as payment, (Diagram 3).  The second is to use Ethereum for both sides of the transaction: ownership transfer and payment, (Diagram 4).  Both these use cases could be implemented.</p> 

<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum have separate blockchains.  So to implement the first use case a 'bridge' is needed between the blockchains to verify the bitcoin transaction on the Ethereum blockchain by relaying the bitcoin transaction to the smart contract.  This bridge has been implemented in Ethereum and is called BTC Relay.<a href="#16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p>The following diagram shows the real property transaction processs in the first use case:</p>

<div class="centerarrowdiagram">
	<p class="flowheading2">Diagram 3: Arrow Flow Diagram of buyer/seller transaction process.  Ownership transfer: Ethereum;  Payment: Bitcoin</p>
	<div class="centerArrow">

			<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow1">Seller calls smart contract, advertising their real property and their bitcoin address</div>
			<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow2">Buyer sends bitcoin to sellers bitcoin address</div>
			<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow3">BTC Relay verifys buyers bitcoin transaction to sellers bitcoin address</div>

		</div>
		<div id="time1"></div><div id="time2"><div id="timeText">time taken: < 60 minutes</div></div>
	</div>
</div>

<p>In the first step of the above diagram, the relevant smart contract is called by the seller.  Only the owner can call the smart contract and therefore put the real property up for sale.  The smart contract would check the data sent with the owners transaction against the ownership details stored in the smart contract.</p>      

<p>Before a contract can be called it must be written and deployed to the blockchain, which is done only once.  The contract in this case would be written by the Land Registry.  Once a contract is deployed on the blockchain it is permanent and immutable.  But contracts can call other contracts.  Also a variable in a contract can be coded that allows mutable links to any contract.  That means that any data that changes over time could be pointed to in a new smart contract, for example tax rates.</p>

<p>In the second step the buyer sends a bitcoin transaction to the sellers bitcoin address, given by the seller.  The transaction contains a field called OP_RETURN that can hold data.  This data field would contain identifier details of the buyer:  the buyers Ethereum address, the real property address and the buyers name.  Other data could be added but because of the size contraints of the data field it may be necessary to store this data as a hash.</p>

<p>"A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string, which is called the hash value (sometimes called a message digest, a digital fingerprint, a digest or a checksum)."<a href="#17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p>The third step involves relaying the confirmation of the bitcoin transaction to the above mentioned smart contract.  Bitcoin has been used as the payment in this example, but if ether was used in step 2 this process would be simpler. i.e. removes the need for BTC Relay.</p>

<p>The fourth step is where the contract executes, putting the buyers details on the blockchain.  Smart contracts are immutable but they also contain a small amount of mutable storage. A hash of the buyer's identifiers, mentioned above, would be put here.  A contract can hold 2^261 possible records<a href="#18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> of real properties.  Each hash would represent the current owner of an individual real property, and would be stored in one of these records.  This data would be the proof of ownership of a real property.</p>  

<p>Real property ownership and transfer can be tracked through time on the blockchain by searching for the various transactions on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, so the Land Registry could query these databases finding the chain of current and past ownership of every real property.  It is the data fields in transactions as well as the storage in the smart contract that would contain a complete history and record of ownership and transfer of real properties.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the real property transaction processs in the second use case:</p>

<div class="centerarrowdiagram">
	<p class="flowheading2">Diagram 4: Arrow Flow Diagram of buyer/seller transaction process. Ownership transfer: Ethereum; Payment: Ether</p>

		</div>
		<div id="time3"></div><div id="time4"><div id="timeText2">time taken: < 6 minutes</div></div>
	</div>
</div>

<p>The process shown in Diagram 4 is simpler than Diagram 3 in both design and use.  It uses ether as the payment currency and therefore BTC relay is not needed.  Implementing the Ethereum only option would be the 'easier' solution, but offering both solutions would provide redundency and flexibility.</p>

<p>While presenting the major steps in the real property transaction process the above two diagrams are a simplified overview.  Current processes such as property price negotiation, funding, including deposit, surveys, conveyancing searches, and the property chain (as distinct from the blockchain) that are currently handled by intermediaries would need to be developed around this new blockchain model and coded into Ethereum's smart contracts.</p>

<p>The way in which the real property would be added to the blockchain by the Land Registry is through the form AP1.</p>
<h4 id="h4_7">Form AP1</h4>

<p>Currently, changes to the state of the register in the database at the Land Registry, representing transfer of ownership, are done through the form AP1.  Form AP1 can be submitted in paper medium, but the Land Registry now offers the electronic Document Registration Service (e-DRS) accepting the form in electronic form with an electronic signature.</p>

<p>The form AP1, in both formats, would be replaced by the blockchain technology mentioned above, but like the transfer of records to the blockchain being a measured process, and the need to use the form to put the first instance of the real property record on the blockchain, the form will be around for some time.  But after this first instance the form will no longer be necessary for that real property, as future transfers will be done by the smart contract.</p>

<p>To implement the transfer to the blockchain the elctronic version of the form would have another two fields.  One for the associated Bitcoin address and the other for the associtated Ethereum address.  Both are an alpha-numberic string of characters.  Both are long,
and are ideally, and really only, meant for copy and paste due to their length and the importance of what they represent and the significant value they store and transfer.
Bitcoin addresses start with a 1 or 3, and Ethereum addresses start with an 0x.  This distinction is important, so that they
are not mixed up.  The current Land Registry database would add two columns to include these two addresses as fields.
Each property record would then be updated when a completed AP1 form was submitted.</p> 

<p>After reception of a completed modified AP1 form from a solicitor, with one of it's Ethereum addresses the Land Registry would call the relevant smart contract with the intention to transfer
the ownership information of the property to the associated Ethereum address.  The Land Registry would basically put the property 'up for
sale' on the blockchain, but only the associated Ethereum address that was registered via the AP1 form and
in the Land Registry database could 'buy' the property.  The owner would send a token Bitcoin or Ethereum payment to the Land
Registry and the ownership would be transferred through the transaction.  This token amount could be set to cover 
Land Registry costs.  Once this is done the property is on the blockchain.  The Land Registry would need to make a note of which properties had been transferred to the blockchain.  Maybe through the use of a flag on each affected record in it's database.</p>
 
<p>One important feature of the Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses mentioned above, is that they will be Multisignature.  One of the reasons for this is that a very important part of the real property transaction process is the source of funding.  The way in which financial intermediaries secure and maintain control over their loan in the absense of a title deed, and an important role for solicitors, is discussed in the section below, Multisignature.</p>

<h4 id="h4_8">Multisignature</h4>

<p>"Multisignature (often called multisig) is a form of technology used to add additional security for bitcoin transactions. Multisignature addresses require another user or users sign a transaction before it can be broadcast onto the block chain. The required number of signatures is agreed at the start once people agree to create the address."<a href="#19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p>Bitcoin has introduced multisig addresses recently.  These addresses start with a 3.  Ethereum addresses start with an 0x (thats zero, x).  Ethereum users interact with the Ethereum block chain through two types of account: external accounts and contract accounts.  Every account has an address.  It is the contract account that can be constructed to act as a multisig account.  An example of what is possible with this smart contract is contained in the code <a href="#20">here</a> on github.  But the smart contract would be constructed and written differently for the purposes of a real property transaction.</p>

<p>Initially multi-sig addresses main function was to act as protection against theft of bitcoin and ether, by requiring more than one signature to verify a transaction.  Further applications of multi-sig have been thought up.<a href="#21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>  A variation on one of these uses, for the purpose of real property transactions, multi-sig can be used to give 3rd parties control over their interests.</p>

<p>Most real properties require some form of funding.  The funding of a real property is primarily a financial intermediary, usually a bank. Traditionally this funding is secured on the real property with which it was bought.  And until this debt was paid, the funder kept the title deed.  With the move to a blockchain model, and in the absense of the physical title deed, the financial intermediary needs to have a way to protect it's interest in the real property.  A multi-sig account can allow the intermediary to maintain partial control of the account, and therefore the funds and ownership transfers that occur through it.</p>

<p>This will be done with the multi-sig feature called called m-of-n.  n is the total signitaries for that address, and m is the total necessary to verify the transaction. In the case of the real property a 2-of-3 multi-sig address could be used.  The owner would be one signatary, the bank another, and the third signatary would be a solicitor.</p>

<p>The solicitor would take on the role of arbitor.  They would arbitrate between the buyer/seller and the bank if necessary, also implementing decisions from the courts.  With this setup no one party has ultimate control of the address.  If the bank and the buyer/seller agree both can sign the transaction but if there is a disagreement the buyer/seller would need the arbitor to do anything with the real property, as would the bank.</p>

<p>The arbitor would send the ethereum address of the multi-sig smart contract account to the Land Registry.  The Land Registry would then verify the solicitor and ethereum address by checking a database maintained either by the Law Society, another government organisation, or trusted 3rd party, set up for the verification of arbitor's ethereum addresses.  The arbibor can then recieve the ethereum addresses from the buyer/seller and the financial intermidiary.  Initially The buyer's/seller's ethereum address would be verified by the bank through traditional verification techniques.  The buyer's and the bank's ethereum address would then be added as signatories to this multisignatory address.  Once the real property is on the blockchain, verification of the solicitor's ethereum address could be done through an query in a smart contract to the relevant organisation.</p>

<p>The way in which these blockchain technologies come together and are exposed to the buyer and seller is through a Decentralised App (Dapp).</p>

<h4 id="h4_9">Dapps</h4>

<p>"A dapp is service that enables direct interaction between end users and providers (e.g. connecting buyers and sellers in some marketplace, owners and storers in file storage)."<a href="#22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p>Dapps are implemented by Ethereum in this case.  Basically the parties involved in the real property transaction would use a special kind of App called a Dapp to interact with the above described blockchain-based technology and smart contracts. Dapp is short for Decentralised App and the users would interact with it on a mobile phone or laptop in the same way as a traditional App.</p>

<p>The users would be identified by their account.  The account is the one buyers and sellers would send to their solicitor to create the multi-sig smart contract, that can then be used to buy and sell real property.  The users would then interact with the smart contracts that have been written by the Land Registry.  Buyers would send the specified amount of ether or bitcoin to the sellers multi-sig address and the smart contract would execute and record the buyers ownership infomation in the smart contract.</p>

<p>The Dapp would be the interface between the parties involved in the transaction.  One important component of the Dapp is a messaging system with notifications and maybe a chat bot.  The other important part of a Dapp is its use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  APIs are a way for the Dapp to query and request data and information from other services including databases.  Along with smart contracts these can be used to perform actions such as property price negotiation, funding, handling surveys and conveyancing searches.</p>

<p>In computing terms the Dapp is the 'front end' and the smart contracts and blockchain are the 'back end'.  The front end is what the user sees and interacts with.  Dapp's front end is developed in HTML, CSS and Javascript.  The back end is written in Solidity, a programming language similar to Javascript.  The Land Registry already has a dedicated IT team that could be retasked to develop both the Dapps and the smart contracts.</p>

<p>Although Dapps is part of free Open Source Software the transfer to blockchain technology is involved.  The Land Registry is self financing and could continue to be with revenue generated from transferring records to the blockchain, discussed in the next section.</p>

<h4 id="h4_10">Revenue</h4>

<p>"At the peak of the property boom in 2007, £1 million worth of property was processed every minute in England and Wales."<a href="#23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Based on this information, at the property tranaction rates that the Land Registry hit in 2007 the natural conversion rate would theoretically take at least 24.5<a href="#24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> years to transfer all 24 million records to the blockchain.  This figure is a minimum for the natural conversion rate.  This does not include the time required for planning, design, development, testing and implementation, and other factors to transfer to a blockchain model.  Other factors affecting this estimated time includes growth in quantity of real property, that the same property will be sold more than once during this time period, and variations in the rate at which property is sold.  However, this natural rate of conversion could be speeded up or slowed down if desired.</p>

<p>At the natural rate of conversion it would take at least 24.5 years before the revenue received from the change in state of the register relating to change of ownership as per form AP1 stopped.  The Land Registry would still get the equivalent of the revenue generated by form AP1 due to the transfer of the first instance of the real property to the blockchain during that transistion phase. Further, because bitcoin and ethereum are not designed to store large amounts of data the records (as distinct from ownership details) would have to be stored somewhere.  This could be stored on the Land Registry's database but could be moved to <a href="#25">IPFS</a>. Also records have to be adminsistered including state changes affected by the other forms that the Land Registry processes.  Fees could be charged for this administration.</p>

<p>Fees and charges are coded into the smart contracts so they would be transparent and taken automatically.  This could also be applied to any other fees or charges such as taxation.  This feature of blockchain would provide significant advantages such as cost savings in areas including processing charges, user error in calculating charges, time savings, paperwork, and increasing the speed at which taxes are collected.  Fees and charges could be changed and updated as required.</p>

<p>The current services and their respective fees, charged by the Land Registry are listed <a href="#26">here.</a>  The fees include an incentive for using the e-DRS by cutting the fee in half.  This type of incentive could be used to encourage parties to use the blockchain.</p>

<h4 id="h4_11">Concerns</h4> 

<p>There are many concerns with blockchain and DLT because of it's wide ranging reach and value storage and transfer. The two main concerns with open source blockchain technology that dominate discussion are security and scalability.  Security refers to a number of areas, such as the underlying technology, the storage of accounts and addresses and issues with smart contracts.  Scalability refers to the ability of the blockchains to handle increasing numbers of transactions.  There are other concerns that arise out of the use of blockchain and DLTs, and control thereof.</p>

<ol>

<li><p><u>Underlying Technology</u>: The central cores of both Bitcoin and Ethereum have been resiliant.  The records in both of these blockchains are for all intents and purposes immutable, and records added cannot be changed.  But the most recent transactions at any given time are susceptible to the 'double spend' problem while they are in the process of being verified.  Ensuring that sufficent confirmations are processed reduces this issue.  Other actions include halting transactions when there is a hard fork.  And splitting up large transactions into smaller payments.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Accounts/Addresses</u>: Accounts and address security is very important. Issues in the news about theft have mainly been the result of inadequate handling and protection of the account's and address's information. The underlying technology is sound, but people may drop their laptop or spill coffee on their mobile phone.  Proper redundency, backup and recovery is required.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Issues with smart contracts</u>: Ethereum smart contracts are written in programming languages, and therefore the robustness and operation of the smart contract is dependant on the quality of the code.  The quality of the code in the smart contract and it's importance was highlighted by the Ethereum DAO attack in June 2016 in which an attempt to steal a considerable quantity of tokens took place.  The attempted theft took advantage of a vulnerability in the smart contract code, but after much discussion a hard fork was implemented returning the tokens back to their rightful owners.  There were discussions about whether a hard fork was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Solutions to contract issues include testing on the blockchain's testnet, peer review and incentives through bounties.  The Land Registry has a good reputation, including a customer satisfaction score of 94%, so developers may be happy to assist in testing.  And if the transfer is done at the natural rate it can be tested on one property at a time.  Contracts can test for whether the sale is to and from a registered/verified solicitor address/account. Also control could be reverted back to the Land Registry through a smart contract and multi-sig account if something goes wrong.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Scalability</u>:  Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are undergoing extensive discussion and rapid development regarding scalability.  Ethereum's current release is called Homestead, and has a timeline for further scalability<a href="#27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>  enhancements over the next number of years called Metropolis and Serenity.  Bitcoin is currently testing Segregated Witness, to prevent malleability weakness and in preparation for the possible introduction of the Lightning Network that will allow substantially larger volumes and size of transactions.</p></li> 

<li><p><u>Substantial value transfer</u>: Both sides include substantial value transfer and just one mistake, for example the theft or wrong routing of bitcoin or ether could be substantial.  Blockchain transactions are irreversible. As mentioned above, the core technology is not the issue.  A rigorous system design and extensive testing is needed, but the proposal presented here has tried to minimise the failure of the system.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Cryptocurrency's reputation</u>: There has been a lot of press coverage on cryptocurrency since its introduction in 2009, culminating in the front page coverage of the theft of a substantial quantity of bitcoin from Mt. Gox in 2013.  The vulnerability was the Bitcoin exchange, not the underlying Bitcoin technology, although this has been argued.  The fix is called Segregated Witness.  Blockchain and DLTs are a new technology and are undergoing the same growing pains the early Internet did in the 1990s.  "A common misconception about Bitcoin is that it is not regulated."<a href="#28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> The image is that Bitcoin is dangerous because it is uncontrollable.  But this is not the whole story.  Bitcoin is regulated and government, regulatory bodies and the law is quickly catching up to understand and put in place a framework that will allow it to work in a manner similar to the Internet.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Permission or Permissionless</u>: The argument presented here has been for the use of Bitcoin and Ethereum by the Land Registry, both of which are examples of permissionless based blockchain technologies, i.e. independent of a trusted party.  However as outlined above, consideration has been given to the level of control exercised by the parties involved in the real property transaction, for example the measured transfer of real properties to the blockchain and the use of multi-sig accounts for financial intermediaries, solicitors and buyers and sellers.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Public or Private blockchain</u>: Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of public blockchains.  They are both Open Source Software projects.  One advantage of this is that both have already been developed and are operational.  Use of these would save on development costs.  There has been a move by Government to shift to OSS. The Land Registry already offers access to title deeds of real property so property information being public on the blockchain is not of as a big step.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Exchanging fiat</u>: Both costs and account set up are and could be expensive and time consuming.  Sending a bitcoin payment is cheap, but converting from fiat currency to bitcoin is more complicated at the moment.  Setting up the bitcoin account takes time as digital asset exchange companies are required to undertake Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) checks.  In addition, the current source of the large amount of fiat currency required for the purpose of buying the majority of real properties is a financial intermediary.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Social Engineering (Security)</u>: Blockchain technologies make the real property transaction simpler, quicker and easier with transactions taking place using a Dapp.  Although it is designed with the buyer and seller in mind the human factor needs careful consideration.  Impulse purchases and sales, coersion and password and account information extraction have human elements.  Also the anonymity of accounts and one way nature of the payment transactions are factors.  The multi-sig account, and the role of its arbitor, reversion of a real property to the Land Registry, and maybe cooling off periods, provide the main protection to some of these elements but systems need deisgning to accomodate these factors.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Financial Intermediaries Capital Requirements</u> (a run on a bank): The way the financing system around the real property transaction process is designed is very important.  If, for example, one financial intermediary supplied 'all' of the financing for one property chain the net actual financing would be comparitively very small compared to the total value of all the real properties on the property chain.  Another case could be that if different financial intermediaries with many real property loans they may obtain financing through a daily bridge loan in the expectation of the stastical assessment that there will always be homes bought and sold in its 'portfolio', but this could be greatly strained if the norm varies.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Quantum computing</u>: The whole DLT system is secured on cryptography.  One of quantum computers main use is to break cryptographic algorithms.  Accounts and addresses could be compromised and the contents spent or transferred bacause of this.  There have been articles about solutions to this problem but this is relatively new.</p> </li>

</ol>

<h4 id="h4_12">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Blockchain and DLTs have the potential to transform and greatly improve the property transaction process, reducing the transaction time down to days.  The Land Registry is a crucial party to this process because of its database of 24 million property records.</p>

<p>The database and the operations on it could be performed and stored on the blockchain.  The blockchain technologies that could do this are the largest Open Source Software projects by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>

<p>A property can be bought with bitcoin, digital cash, in exchange for the transfer of ownership details handled by Ethereum's smart contracts, the exchange recorded on the blockchain, secure, and free from alteration.</p>

<p>The basic setup of the blockchain technologies would involve a change in the form AP1 to get the first instance of a property on the blockchain, and a multi-sig smart contract to maintain control over ownership between the owner, financial intermediary and a solicitor.</p> 

<p>The total time to transfer to blockchain at the natural rate of conversion would take a minimum of 24.5 years.  The real property can be tansferred one at a time.  Mass transfer or network effects are not necessary.  The Land Registry would still need to processs the updated version of the AP1 form during this time for each property transfer.  Property records would still need to be administered, but subsequent ownership transfer would be performed on the blockchain.  Smart contracts would have to be designed, coded and implemented.</p>

<p>The use of Bitcoin and Ethereum does not imply loss of central control.  The design mentioned here includes current parties who are still important to the process of buying and selling a real property.  By design, public blockchains are transparent, but information can be stored in a hash, to protect personal information.  Title deeds already can be accessed by anyone.  Blockchain would help with proper taxation and machine learning could help with pricing property properly.</p>

<p>Involved parties would interact with the blockchain through a decentralised app, called a Dapp.  This would be just like using a website for the user.  They would be identified by their account and the transaction could be done on a mobile phone or laptop.</p>

<p>The property transaction process is complicated and so any solution addressing this process is going to be involved too.  But the solution proposed above would include all current parties, whilst improving the real property transaction process.</p>
