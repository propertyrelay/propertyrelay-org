<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>"Distributed ledger technology has the potential to transform the delivery of public and private services."<a href="#7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>  Blockchain, which is a part of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), has been referred to as "...the Internet of value." <a href="#10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>  DLT is being analysed by many different organisations at home and abroad for use for many different applications involving value.  The UK Government's Chief Scientist has issued a report about the technology.<a href="#12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>  Sweden's Land Registry is investigating: 'Sweden conducts trials of a blockchain smart contracts technology for land registry' <a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and 'Estonia has an electronic land registry...reducing land transfers from three months to a little over a week.'<a href="#5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>  

<p>These various organisations are looking at different forms of DLT.  Both private and public DLTs are being investigated, however there is a move to use Open Source Software(OSS) that is the basis for public DLTs.  OSS "...provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose."<a href="#13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>  The United States government is making guidelines for its agencies regarding OSS.  A memo was released on 8th August 2016 by Tony Scott, Whitehouse CIO, about open sourcing up to 20% of government agency's software<a href="#6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.  The two leading OSS blockchain projects by market capitalisation are Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Each feature special attributes that offer an improved solution to the process of buying and selling a real property.</p>

<p>The Land Registry is a very important part of the real property transaction process as it oversees significant value transfer and storage.  Some of or all of the Land Registry's functions could be transferred to the blockchain, transforming and greatly improving the real property transaction process for buyers and sellers.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The <a href="#blockchain">Blockchain</a> is an immutable distributed database with special technological attributes that have the potential to transform and greatly improve the real property transaction ecosystem.  At its center is the storage and transfer of ownership, of which the Land Registry is a very important part.  The blockchain-based technology that can significantly improve the transfer of ownership of real property is called a <a href="#smartContracts">smart contract.</a></p>

<p>At the moment the real property transaction process - the sale of a property -  typically is a long process, taking about 2 months on average.  Improvements in the process have been made with advances in technology. For example the Land Registry offers the AP1 form and the use of electronic conveyancing and electronic signatures as introduced by the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Blockchain technologies change the dynamic of the relationships between the involved parties of the real property transaction.  It allows peer to peer transactions, with an altered role for the 3rd parties, also called intermediaries.  What this means for the Land Registry is that key parts of the title to land and property would be stored in a smart contract on the blockchain in the form of a <a href="#hash">hash</a>, with a transformed and improved way of transferring ownership.</p>

<p>This arrangement could reduce the real property transaction time down to days, rather than months.  The Land Registry could charge a fixed fee or introduce a scaled charging structure based on the timeframe of the transaction.  The quicker and/or more involved the required response and resolution the higher the charge.  The fee structure could be fully transparent, and updatable depending on demand. Charges could be shown to the buyer so they have the choice.  Blockchain-based technology also could help automate and speed up the collection of taxes.</p>

<p>Property has significant value, it is governed by laws, and its transfer can be complicated.  This means that there are a number of parties involved in the transaction process.  In each transaction usually there is the buyer and seller, the Land Registry, solicitors, banks, Estate Agents and a surveyor.  The transaction process is varied based on the property and the circumstances of those involved in the process.  But many real property transactions involve operations and exceptions that have standardised, quick and/or formalised, responses.  This lends the real property process to automation using Blockchain-based and Information Technology.</p>

<p>For most of its history land and property registration with the Land Registry has be voluntary.  Now only when an unregistered property is sold is there a requirement to register the property. This same voluntary approach can be taken with Blockchain technology. Sellers can choose whether to use the Blockchain allowing a gradual transition.  However, the benefits and convenience of using this new technology, combined with ubiqutous access to technologies including computers and mobile phones that are connected to the Internet, will hopefully pull sellers onto the platform.  And once a property has been put on the blockchain, subsequent transactions involving that property should be a lot quicker and streamlined.</p>

<p>Please see the notes and references below for definitions of blockchain related terms mentioned throughout. e.g. Hash, etc.</p> 

<h4>Land Registry</h4>

<p>The purpose of the Land Registry is to maintain a register of ownership of land and property in England and Wales.  The Land Registry has been through a lot of changes since it was formed in 1862.  Inititally the registry was in the form of paper title deeds and plans.  Subsequently records of titles were transferred onto a database, where over 24 million records are currently maintained. </p> 

<p>There are two factors about the Land Registry that lends itself to the conversion to a Blockchain model.  The Land Registry:</p>
<ul>
	<li>maintains a register of land and property ownership in a database;</li>
	<li>changes the state of the register in that database, representing transfer of ownership.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two factors, the storage of records in a database, and the transfer of ownership in this database, can be implemented using blockchain.</p>

<h4 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h4>

<p>A blockchain—originally, block chain—is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of data records called blocks secured from tampering and revision.  Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block.<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p>The blockchain has special attributes, based around a distributed database, that means that property ownership information and digital monetary value can be transferred, and stored securely, on the blockchain.  Change in state of ownership in exchange for digital monetary value can be performed entirely on the blockchain, through peer-to-peer transactions that are then added to the blockchain, without the traditional verification of an intermediary.</p>

<p>Traditionally an electonic financial transaction has required a trusted intermediary to verify the transaction between two parties, such as a bank making a record of a transaction  in a bank account on a centralised database.  Blockchain is 'trustless' meaning that transactions can be between two parties without a trusted intermediary.  This is because the blockchain verifies the transaction in place of the intermediary.</p> 

<p>The reason for the blockchain is to enable peer-to-peer transactions of value or data representing value.  It is through these transactions that property ownership is transferred in exchange for value, also called digital cash, and stored on the blockchain.</p>

<p>A distributed database means many databases on many nodes, forming a network.  A node is an individual computer, and a network is many computers linked to one another. The aim of the network, where blockchain is concerned, is to maintain the same version of the data on every database on every node.</p>

<p>Every database in this network has records added to it, called blocks, in a "linear, chronological order"<a href="#24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> and timestamped, linking the previous blocks to one another in a chain, which once added are immutable due to a "'trustless' proof mechanism"<a href="#25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>.  These blocks consist of transactions sent between users of the blockchain.  Only consensus between nodes on the network determine whether a transaction is legitimate or not.  The first instance of the transaction, as denoted by the timestamp, is considered the proper one.  All other instances of that transaction are rejected by the network, preventing the 'double spend' problem.</p>

<p>Consensus is performed by 'miners', who verify the blocks as they are created and added to the blockchain.  In exchange for this service they recieve a fee.  This fee is the digital cash, the currency, of the blockchain.  This currency can be transacted on the blockchain and can be used as payment in exchange for the transfer of property ownership on the blockchain.</p> 

<p>With these attributes, as well as digital currency and other data, a real property transaction between the buyer and seller can be done entirely on the blockchain.  The ownership details of the seller can be transferred to the buyer in exchange for the digital currency. A record of both sides of this transaction is stored on the blockchain.  Once the record is on the blockchain it cannot be changed.  Records can only be added.</p>

<p>The above described blockchain model is that of the first blockchain based technology, called Bitcoin.  There have been further developments of, and variations on, this model including those of Distributed Ledger Technologies.</p>

<p>The two blockchain based technologies referred to below, for the purposes of transferring property ownership details in exchange for digital cash, are Bitcoin and Ethereum.  In it's initial incarnation, introduced in 2008, blockchain referred to a growing database of electronic cash transactions, called Bitcoin.</p> 

<h4>Bitcoin</h4>

<p>"Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system."<a href="#9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> "...and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain, which uses bitcoin as its unit of account. "<a href="#8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p>Bitcoin is digital cash and within the context of a real property transaction can be seen as the payment from buyer to seller.  Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency which means that it is based on cryptography to secure the system and verify payments.  The advantages of using this mechanism is that it's secure, quick, incurs low fees, and is transparent.  It also means that it can be used with other Distributed Ledger Technologies.</p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions confirm on average in 10 minutes, but depends on the network, and will vary with the amount of fee paid.  A confirmation is similar in nature to clearing in a bank.  The greater the number of confirmations the greater the permanence of the transaction. As the payments for real property are significant value 6 confirmations or more is advisable. Transaction fees are very low at the moment.  Well under a $1 per transaction.  Transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, meaning they can be seen by anyone.  But the owners of the addresses that hold, receive or send Bitcoin are annonymous.</p>

<p>Because of the way Bitcoin and blockchains are designed it can interact with other DLTs.  With the digital cash payment recorded in the database, which is immutable and timestamped, this bitcoin payment information can be verified and used by the DLT that enables automation of the real property transaction, called a smart contract.</p>

<h4 id="smartContracts">Smart contracts</h4>

<p>"Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary. Smart contracts usually also have a user interface and often emulate the logic of contractual clauses."
<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p>The DLT that automates the transfer of ownership of the real property and the storage of the owners details on the blockchain, the sellers side of the real property tranaction, is handled by smart contracts.  This automated transfer of ownership is triggered by the fullfillment of the requirement specified by the owner in the smart contract.  i.e. the payment of the sale price of the real property, in bitcoins or Ethereums currency, ether.</p>

<p>The function of a smart contract is best explained with a comparison between how an online transaction may take place, in Diagram 1, and how the process of a smart contract would be applied to this same transaction process, in Diagram 2.  Diagram 2 is a hypothectical process that contains a hypothectical entity called an Automated Independent Distribution Centre (AIDR) that executes functions based on the actions of the parties involved. Basically this AIDR ensures that if the seller recieves the payment the item is automatically delivered to the buyer, whoever that is.</p>

		<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow4a">AIDR delivers item to seller</div>

	</div>
	
</div>

<p>The Consumer Rights Act 2015<a href="#22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> makes it the legal obligation of the seller to deliver the items to the buyer.  What the smart contract, the AIDR, does in this case is facilitate and enforce this obligation once the payment is received by the seller.</p>

<p>The process of selling something with nominal value probably doesn't need the added processes introduced in Diagram 2, but exchanging things of considerable and significant value, this escrow-type service would provide security to both the seller and buyer.  In particular, the Automated Independent Distribution Centre only releases the item when the seller recieves the payment.</p>

<p>Real property has considerable and significant value, and becuase of the design of the blockchain, digital cash and smart contracts, the process similar to that shown in Diagram 2 can be translated to a real property transaction.  Instead of transferring a physical item, the smart contract transfers the ownership of real property in exchange for payment, all done on the blockchain, reducing the process down to days.  The OSS DLT that has the second highest market cap to Bitcoin, and implements smart contacts, is Ethereum.

<h4>Ethereum</h4>

<p>"Ethereum is a public blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency called ether."<a href="#11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p>Ethereum implements smart contracts.  In the context of the a real property transaction, in exchange for a payment in bitcoin or ether to the seller of the real property, the smart contract transfers ownership from the seller to the buyer, and stores this information on the blockchain.</p>

<p>There are two possible uses of DLTs that are presented below. The first is to use Ethereum's smart contracts as the ownership transfer mechanism combined with bitcoin as payment, (Diagram 3).  The second is to use Ethereum for both sides of the transaction: ownership transfer and payment, (Diagram 4).  Both these use cases could be implemented.</p> 

<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum have separate blockchains.  So to implement the first use case a 'bridge' is needed between the blockchains to verify the bitcoin transaction on the Ethereum blockchain by relaying the bitcoin transaction to the smart contract.  This bridge has been implemented in Ethereum and is called BTC Relay.<a href="#26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p>The following diagram shows the real property transaction processs in the first use case:</p>

<div class="centerarrowdiagram">
	<p class="flowheading2">Diagram 3: Arrow Flow Diagram of buyer/seller transaction process.  Ownership transfer: Ethereum;  Payment: Bitcoin</p>
	
	<div class="arrowflowdiagramcontainer">
		
		<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow1">Seller calls smart contract, advertising their real property and their bitcoin address</div>
		<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow2">Buyer sends bitcoin to sellers bitcoin address</div>
		<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow3">BTC Relay verifys buyers bitcoin transaction to sellers bitcoin address</div>
		<div class="arrowflowdiagrambody" id="arrow4">Ethereum contract executes registering the buyers new ownership of the property</div>

	</div>
	<div id="time1"></div><div id="time2"><div id="timeText">time taken: < 60 minutes</div></div>
	
</div>

<p>In the first step of the above diagram, the relevant smart contract is called by the seller.  Before a contract can be called it must be written and deployed to the blockchain.  The contract in this case would be written by the Land Registry.  Once a contract is deployed on the blockchain it is permanent and immutable.  But contracts can call other contracts.  And also a varible in a contract can be coded that allows links to any contract.</p>

<p>In the second step the buyer sends a bitcoin transaction to the sellers bitcoin address, given by the seller.  The transaction contains a field called OP_RETURN that can hold data.  This data field would contain identifier details of the buyer:  the buyers Ethereum address the real property address and the buyers name.  Other data could be added but because of the size contraints of the data field it may be necessary to store this data as a hash of the data.</p>

<p>The third step involves relaying the confirmation of the bitcoin transaction to the above mentioned smart contract.  Bitcoin has been used as the payment in this example, but if ether was used in step 2 this process would be simpler. i.e. removes the need for BTC Relay.</p>

<p>The fourth step is where the contract executes, putting the buyers details on the blockchain.  Smart contracts are immutable but they also have a small amount of mutable storage. A hash of the buyer's identifiers would be put here.  In fact a contract can hold 2^261 possible records<a href="#14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> of real properties.  Each hash would represent the current owner of an individual real property, and would be stored in one of these records.  This data would be the proof of ownership of a real property.</p>  

<p>Ownership can be tracked through time on the blockchain through the various entries on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, so the Land Registry could query these databases, finding current, and the history of, ownership of every real property.  It is the transactions as well as the storage in the smart contract that would hold all the ownership information.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the real property transaction processs in the second use case:</p>

<div class="centerarrowdiagram">
	<p class="flowheading2">Diagram 4: Arrow Flow Diagram of buyer/seller transaction process. Ownership transfer: Ethereum; Payment: Ether</p>
	
	<div class="arrowflowdiagramcontainer">

	</div>
	<div id="time3"></div><div id="time4"><div id="timeText2">time taken: < 6 minutes</div></div>
</div>

<p>Diagram 4 is simpler than Diagram 3 in both design and use.  It uses ethereum as the payment and therefore BTC relay is not needed.  Implementing the Ethereum only option would be the 'easiest' solution, but offering both solutions would provide redundency.  But the Market Cap of both currencies at the moment - the total amount of currency in circulation - mean that both are incapable for the large volume that the Land Registrys use would require.  This scaling is being addressed by both currencies.</p>

<p>The steps in the above two diagrams are a greatly simplified representation of the real property transaction process.  Many processes before and and during this process are needed.  For example, funding, including deposit, and checks by the surveyor need to be performed before a property is sold.  And also if a property chain is involved, this changes the dynamic of the process.  There are also questions about whether properties are on blockchain or off.  Also, in law property transactions have to be in writing, but like electronic signitures in the Land Registration Act 2002 something could be done.</p>

<h4>Form AP1</h4>

<p>Currently, changes to the state of the register in the database at the Land Registry, representing transfer of ownership, are done through the form AP1.  Form AP1 can be submitted in paper medium, but the Land Registry now offers the electronic Document Registration Service (e-DRS) accepting the form in electronic form with an electronic signiture.</p>

<p>The form AP1, in both formats, would be replaced by the blockchain technology mentioned above, but like the transfer of records to the blockchain being a measured process, and the need to use the form to put the first instance of the record on the blockchain, the form will be around for some time.  But after this first instance the form will no longer be necessary for that real property, as future transfers will be done by the smart contract.</p>

<p>To implement the transfer to the blockchain the elctronic version of the form would have another two fields.  One for the associated Bitcoin
address and the other for the associtated Ethereum address.  Both are an alpha-numberic string of characters.  Both are long,
and are ideally, and really only, meant for cut and paste due to their length and the importance of what they represent and the significant value they store and transfer.
Bitcoin addresses start with a 1 or 3, and Ethereum addresses start with an 0x.  This distinction is important, so that they
are not mixed up.  The current Land Registry database would add two columns to include these two addresses as fields.
Each property record would then be updated when a completed AP1 form was submitted.</p> 

<p>With one of it's Ethereum addresses the Land Registry would call the relevant smart contract with the intention to transfer
the ownership information of the property to the associated Ethereum address.  The Land Registry would basically put the property 'up for
sale' on the blockchain, but only the associated Ethereum address that was registered via the AP1 and
in the Land Registry database could 'buy' the property.  The owner would send a token Bitcoin or Ethereum payment to the Land
 Registry and the ownership would be transferred through the transaction.  This token amount could be set to cover 
 Land Registry costs.  Once this is done the property is on the blockchain.  The Land Registry would need to make a note of which properties had been transferred to the blockchain.  Maybe through the use of a flag on each affected record in the database.</p>
 
<p>One important feature of the Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses mentioned above, is that they will be Multi-Signature.  One of the reasons for this is that a very important part of the real property transaction process is source of funding.  The way in which financial intermediaries secure and maintain control over their loan in the absense of a title deed, and an important role for solicitors, is discussed in the section below, Multi-sig.</p>

<h4>Multi-sig</h4>

<p>"Multisignature (often called multisig) is a form of technology used to add additional security and for bitcoin transactions. Multisignature addresses require another user or users sign a transaction before it can be broadcast onto the block chain. The required number of signatures is agreed at the start once people agree to create the address."<a href="#15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p>Bitcoin has introduced multisig addresses recently.  These addresses start with a 3.  Ethereum addresses start with an 0x (thats zero, x).  Ethereum users interact with the Ethereum block chain through two types of account: external accounts and contract accounts.  It is the contract account that can be constructed to act as a multisig account.  An example of what is possible with this smart contract is contained in the code <a href="#16">here</a> on github.  But the smart contract would be constructed and written differently for the purposes of a real property transaction.</p>

<p>Initially multi-sig addresses main function was to act as protection against theft of bitcoin and ether, by requiring more than one signature to verify a transaction.  Further applications of multi-sig have been thought up.<a href="#18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>  A variation on one of these uses, for the purpose of real property transactions, multi-sig can be used to give 3rd parties control over their interests.</p>

<p>Most real properties require some form of funding.  The funding of a real property is primarily a financial intermediary, usually a bank. Traditionally this funding is secured on the real property with which it was bought.  And until this debt was paid, the funder kept the title deed.  With the move to a blockchain model, and in the absense of the physical title deed, the financial intermediary needs to have a way to protect it's interest in the real property.  A multi-sig account can allow the intermediary to maintain control of the account, and therefore the funds and ownership transfers that occur through it.</p>

<p>This will be done with the multi-sig feature called called m-of-n.  n is the total signitaries for that address, and m is the total necessary to verify the transaction. In the case of the real property a 2-of-3 multi-sig address could be used.  The owner would be one signitary, the bank another, and the third signitary would be a solicitor.</p>

<p>The solicitor would take on the role of arbitor.  They would arbitrate between the buyer/seller and the bank if necessary.  With this setup no one party has ultimate control of the address.  If the bank and the buyer/seller agree both can sign the transaction but if there is a disagreement or other action the buyer/seller would need the arbitor to do anything with the real property, as would the bank.</p>

<p>The arbitor would send the ethereum address of the multi-sig smart contract account to the Land Registry.  The Land Registry would then verify the solicitor and ethereum address through an API call to a database maintained either the Law Society, another government organisation, or trusted 3rd party, set up for the verification of this address.  Then the artibor can recieve the ethereum addresses from the buyer/seller and the financial intermidiary.  The buyer's/seller's ethereum address would be verified by the bank through traditional verification techniques.  The buyer's and the bank's ethereum address would then be added as signitories to this multi-sig address.  Once the real property is on the blockchain, verification of the solicitor's ethereum address could be done through the contract.</p>

<h4>Dapps</h4>

<p>"A dapp is service that enables direct interaction between end users and providers (e.g. connecting buyers and sellers in some marketplace, owners and storers in file storage)."<a href="#23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p>Dapps are implemented by Ethereum.  Basically the parties involved in the real property transaction would use a special kind of App called a Dapp to interact with the above described blockchain-based technology. Dapp is short for Decentralised App and the users would interact with it on a mobile phone or laptop in the same way as a traditional App.</p>

<p>The users would be identified by their account.  The account is the one buyers and sellers would send to their solicitor to create the multi-sig smart contract, that can then be used to buy and sell real property.  The users would then interact with the smart contracts that have been written by the Land Registry.  Buyers would send the specified ether or bitcoin to the sellers multi-sig address and the contract would execute and record the buyers ownership infomation in the contract.</p>

<p></p> 

<h4>Revenue</h4>

<p>"At the peak of the property boom in 2007, £1 million worth of property was processed every minute in England and Wales."<a href="#19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Based on this information, at the property tranaction rates that the Land Registry hit in 2007 the natural conversion rate would theoretically take at least 23<a href="#20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> years to transfer all 24 million records to the blockchain.  This figure is a minimum for the natural conversion rate.  This does not include the time required for planning, design, development, testing and implementation, and other factors to transfer to a blockchain model.  Other factors affecting this estimated time includes growth in quantity of real property, that the same property will be sold more than once during this time period, and variations in the rate at which property is sold.  However, this natural rate of conversion could be speeded up if desired.</p>

<p>At the natural rate of conversion it would take at least 23 years before the revenue received from the change in state of the register relating to change of ownership as per form AP1 stopped.  The Land Registry would still get the equivilent of the revenue generated by form AP1 due to the transfer of the first instance of the real property to the blockchain during that transistion phase. Further, becuase bitcoin and ethereum are not designed to store large amounts of data the records would have to be stored somewhere.  Also records have to be adminsistered including state changes affected by the other forms that the Land Registry processes.  Fees could be charged for this administration.</p>

<p>Becuase the fees and charges are coded into the smart contracts they would be transparent and taken automatically.  This could also be applied to any other fees or charges such as taxation.  This feature of blockchain would provide significant advantages such as cost savings in areas including processing charges, user error in calculating charges, time savings, paperwork, and increasing the speed at which taxes are collected.  Fees and charges could be changed and updated as required.</p>

<p>The current services and their respective fees, charged by the Land Registry are listed <a href="#17">here.</a>  The fees include an incentive for using the e-DRS by cutting the fee in half.  This type of incentive could be used to encourage parties to use the blockchain.</p>

<h4>Concerns</h4> 

<p>There are many concerns with blockchain and DLT because of it's wide ranging reach. The two main concerns with open source blockchain technology that dominate discussion are security and scalability.  Security refers to a number of areas, such as the underlying technology, the storage of accounts and addresses and the writing of smart contracts.  Scalability refers to the ability of the blockchains to handle increasing numbers of transactions.  There are other concerns that arise out of the use of blockchain and DLTs, and control thereof.</p>

<ol>

<li><p><u>Cryptocurrency's image</u>: There has been a lot of press coverage on cryptocurrency since its introduction in 2009, culminating in the front page coverage of the theft of a substantial quantity of bitcoin from Mt. Gox in 2013.  The vulnerability was the Bitcoin exchange, not the underlying Bitcoin technology, although this has been argued.  The fix is called Segregated Witness.  Blockchain and DLTs are a new technology and are undergoing the same growing pains the early Internet did in the 1990s.  "A common misconception about Bitcoin is that it is not regulated."<a href="#27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> The image is that Bitcoin is dangerous because it is uncontrollable.  But this is not the whole story.  Bitcoin is regulated and government, regulatory bodies and the law is quickly catching up to understand and put in place a framework that will allow it to work in a manner similart to the Internet.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Permission or Permissionless</u>: The argument presented here has been for the use of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which are examples of permissionless based blockchain technologies, i.e. independent of a trusted party.  However as outlined above, consideration is given to the level of control exercised by the parties involved in the real property transaction, for example the measured transfer of real properties to the blockchain and the use of multi-sig accounts for financial intermediaries, solicitors and buyers and sellers.</p></li>

<li><p>Both blockchains have a testnet.  Peer review.  And if the transfer is done at the natural rate the success can be checked on a few properties before rolling it out.

The Land Registry already has a good reputation as per [reference].  contracts can be designed to call any contract.  Control could be reverted to the Land Registry if something goes wrong, designed into the contract.  Processes can be designed to store accounts and addresses safely.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Security</u>: The value transfer in a real property transaction. Both sides include substantial value transfer and just one mistake, for example the theft or wrong routing of bitcoin or ether could be substantial.</p></li>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Blockchain and DLTs have the potential to transform and greatly improve the property transaction process, reducing the transaction time down to days.  The Land Registry is a crucial party to this process becuase of its database of 24 million property records.</p>

<p>The database and the operations on it could be performed and stored on the blockchain.  The blockchain technologies that could do this are the largest Open Source Software projects by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>

<p>A property can be bought with bitcoin, digital cash, in exchange for the transfer of ownership details handled Ethereum's smart contracts, the exchange recorded on the blockchain, secure, and free from alteration.</p>

<p>The basic setup of the blockchain technologies would involve a change in the form AP1 to get the first instance of a property on the blockchain, and a multi-sig smart contract to maintain control over ownership between the owner, financial intermediary and a solicitor.</p> 

<p>The total time to transfer to blockchain at the natural rate of conversion would take a minimum of 23 years.  The real property can be tansferred one at a time.  Mass transfer or network effects are not necessary.  The Land Registry would still need to processs the updated version of the AP1 form during this time for each property transfer.  Property records would still need to be administered, but subsequent ownership transfer would be performed on the blockchain.  Smart contracts would have to be designed, coded and implemented.</p>

<p>The use of Bitcoin and Ethereum does not imply loss of central control.  The design mentioned here includes current parties are still important to the process of buying and selling a real property.  By design, public blockchains are transparent, but information can be stored in a hash, to protect personal information.  Title deeds already can be accessed by anyone.  Property prices could help with proper taxation and machine learning could help with pricing property properly.</p>

<p>Involved parties would interact with the blockchain through a decentralised app, called a Dapp.  This would be just like using a website for the user.  They would be identified by their account and the transaction could be done on a mobile phone or laptop.</p>

<p>The property transaction process is complicated and so any solution addressing this process is going to be involved too.  But the solution proposed above would include all current parties, whilst improving the real property transaction process.</p>

<h4>Basic suggestion for implementation</h4>

<p>The code for the smart contract would be need to be written.  This is one of the most complex parts of the use of blockchain technology.  The contract would contain functions for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>first transfer from land registry to registered owner;</li>
	<li>transfer of ownership;</li>
	<li>transfer with nominal consideration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically the hash in the smart contract will define ownership. Only the Land Registry can add a hash of the property record to the smart contract by initialising the first 'sale' to the current owner as per their ethereum address on the form AP1.  Owners can only change the current hash stored in the smart contract, their ownership of the property.  This arrangement guarantees hash validity and means that there can be no other unwanted or unintended additions or changes to the smart contract outside of these two actions.</p>

<p>The Land Registry would initialise the first transfer of ownership to the smart contract.  Subsquent transfers would be checked by the Land Registry and any issues concerning transfer would be directed to it. </p>

<p>A hash of the record would be stored and if there were changes to it since the last transaction then this would be flagged and dealt with by the Land Registry.</p>

<p>Multisig is possible to implement in the contract.</p>


<p>The whole title record could be stored on a distributed database like IPFS.</p>
 
<p>The 32 byte hash stored in the smart contract is the proof of ownership of that property.</p>

<p>notes</p>

<p>The term 'the internet of value'.</p>

<p>The multi-sig account would have 3 keys for 3 parties.  The owner, the funder, and a solicitor or arbitor.</p>

<p>The paper doesn't consider transfer between crypto currencies and fiat currency, but there are intermediaries like 
coinbase that do this, addressing KYC and AML.  Conversion between fiat and a crypto currency such as Bitcoin, and payment times, would be quick, less than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>bitcoin weaknesses(?)</p>

<p>Sending a bitcoin payment is cheap, but converting from fiat currency to bitcoin is more complicated at the moment.  Setting up the bitcoin account takes time as digital asset exchange companies are required to undertake Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) checks.  In addition, the current source of the large amount of fiat currency required for the purpose of buying the majority of real properties is a financial intermediary.</p>  

<p>With the introduction of another tradable digital asset into the real property transaction process comes the features of existing financial instruments, like volatility. Usually, becuase the seller's loan would would be secured on the property they would want to convert to fiat as soon as possible. Financial instruments like futures, insurance or options could be used to mitigate risk of currency fluctations at any stage of the transaction process. If the property is not secured then the seller of the property may keep the Bitcoin for speculation or diversification.</p>

<p>Real property transactions are large and could influence the price of bitcoin.  But with regard to the transfer, the price of bitcoin doesn't matter as long as it doesn't drop to nominal levels.  The current market cap, or total bitcoins in circulation is about £7 billion, ($10 billion). But bitcoin is not the only electonic cash payment.</p>

<p>smart contracts</p>

<p>Smart Contracts are similar to the US service used in real property exchange called escrow.</p>


<p>It could do this by putting the ethereum address, property address and name(s) in the form of a hash in the mutable storage in the smart contract of the to a new owner based on the new owner satisfying some condition that the current owner specified.  Remortgaging is another use case.  The 'data' part of the transaction that is the payment part of the transaction would contain the present hash.</p>

<p>In the case of the application of smart contracts to the transfer of ownership, the buyer would send money to the smart contract, and the smart contract would put the buyers details on the title deed.</p>

<p>A smart contract is written once, and can be called any number of times.</p>

<p>The smart contract has the potential to transform the way real property is transacted.  The Land Registry is central to 
that.  This is because Title ownership is guaranteed by the government and law.  If title ownership can be transferred
at the same time that payment is received it removes many of the processes that need to be done.  For example exchange of
contracts would not be required as the transfer of Title is transferred by the smart contract automatically on the
reception of payment.</p>

<p>A contract is immutable, but it is possible for contracts to call other contracts, and there is also the possible to store a mutable value such as a contract address so subordinate contracts/ a tree of contracts can be referred to.</p>

<p>ethereum</p>

<p>This transaction information is stored in the transaction and in the smart contract themselves.  A smart contact can store 2^261 possible record references in the form of hashes.  Transactions are immutable but this 32 byte storage is mutable.  </p>

<p>Two types of accounts: external and contract.</p>

<p>2^261 possible records of real properties in the form of hashes.</p>

<p>In the context of the Land Registry Ethereum can be seen as the transfer of ownership of real property.</p>

<p>'Ethereum clients maintain a state database of all contracts, which is anologous to Bitcoins UTXO set.' from
forum.ehtereum.org, 'Understanding data storage'.</p>

<p>Ethereum is similar to Bitcoin.  It is based on a distributed ledger, but its design uses accounts instead.  There
are two types of of account: externally controlled and contract accounts.</p>

<h4>Current Blockchain Technologies</h4>


<p>The Land Registry's database may be distributed in one sense, but the distinction between that and a Blockchain based
distributed system is that it facilitates transactions that require no trusted 3rd party to validate them.</p>
<p>There is a testnet on Ethereum where all it's features can be tested before moving to the mainnet.</p>

<p>Register: 'an official list or record of names or items.'</p>
<p>for title transfer and storage at the Land Registry.  
There are many advantages of using Blockchain technology by the Land Registry.  The 4 main advantages when considering this proposal
are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Reducing costs;</li>
	<li>Maintain a record of property titles;</li>
	<li>Ensure the proper collection of taxes;</li>
	<li>Reduce property transaction times.</li>
</ol>
<p>The blockchain and associated technologies mentioned in this paper can help achieve these objectives.</p>  
<p>The solution to achieve these 4 main goals use two open source blockchain technologies called Bitcoin and Ethereum.  For the
purposes of this use-case Bitcoin
is used as digital cash, and Ethereum is used for smart contracts.  Both store their peer-to-peer transactions on their
blockchain, which is a distributed ledger of immutable transactions.</p>
<p>This proposal does not include how to convert fiat currency to bitcoin, or the way that the remaining
properties on your database that have not been converted are transferred to the blockchain, or the daily operations
 of the land registry.  This paper is about the transfer of property, and transactions and storage of the titles.</p>
<p>Ebay anaology for explaining how smart contracts work.  Ethereum is 'if this, then that'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This essay introduces one possible method for the Land Registry using blockchain technology that would improve security of data,
reduce costs, and reduce transaction times.</p>
<p>The Land Registry:</p>
<p>The blockchain offers 
a new paradigm, a new model, of how the Land Registry could function.</p> 
<p>The technology at the Land Registry is built around the following two things:</p> 



<p>The first issue, the storage of records in a database, is addressed by the blockchain.  The records currently held by the Land Registry could be transferred onto the blockchain.  The overiding reason to transfer records onto the blockchain instead of them being held by the Land Registry is that it greatly improves many aspects of the home buying and selling process.</p>

<p>Basically once a record is on the blockchain that record is immutable, meaning it can't be changed.  However, additional information can be added to the record.  So a new owner can be added to the record, but the previous owner is still listed on the record, building up a chain of ownership.  The last owner of the real property listed on the record is the difinitive one.  But not just anyone can add their name to the blockchain.  The Land Registry would have control of the first instance of ownership of a property put on the blockchain.  The only way for this chain of records to be added to would be through a smart contract.</p>

<p>The blockchain is a chain of blocks.  In those blocks are transactions. The blockchain has been called 'The trust protocol'.<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>  The basis of the blockchain is that it is peer-to-peer, requiring no third party.</p>

<p>The main reason to transfer the database to the blockchain is a technology built on top of it called Smart Contracts.</p>

<p>Below is a basic introduction to how blockchain technologies relate to, and their use case by, the Land Registry.</p> 

<p>Bitcoin is digital cash, but can be seen as the transfer of value between users.
  Ethereum could also be seen as a transfer of value but it's main function is what's called a smart contract.  Both store
transactions in a database, but unlike the centralised database of the Land Registry both use a distributed database.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has a database of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO).  But its main feature is that it's distributed.  A copy 
of the database is a ledger consisting of blocks in a chain. </p> 

<p>One of the main concerns about the blockchain is the removal of intermediaries.  This proposal suggests a measured
transistion, one record at a time, not a mass migratation.  In the fashion that the Land Registry has taken in the past to
property registration.</p>
<p>The second issue, the transfer of ownership of the real property, is addressed by the smart contract. The smart contract transfers ownership of the land or property in exchange for consideration.  </p>
<p>Bitcoin is used by the buyer to make a payment to the current owner.  </p>

<p>The development and testing of the smart contracts and associated technology can be done on the Bitcoin and Ethereum testnets.</p>
