<H2>A proposal for the Land Registry using Blockchain technologies</H2>
<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Blockchain technologies have the potential to greatly improve the real property transaction ecosystem.
The purpose of the Land Registry is to maintain a register of ownership of land and property in England and Wales.  Inititally the registry
was in the form of paper title deeds and plans.  Subsequently title deeds were transferred onto
a centralised database, where they currently are maintained.  The Blockchain is a distributed database that could transform
not only the way records are stored	by the Land Registry, but also how ownership is transferred, among many other improvements.
  This could significantly speed up real property transaction times, and also automate and speed up the collection of taxes.
  (By distributed it is not refering to Hadoop.)</p>
<p>There are two factors about the Land Registry that lends itself to the conversion to a Blockchain model.  The Land Registry:</p>
<ul>
	<li>maintains a register of land and property ownership in a database;</li>
	<li>changes the state of the register in that database, representing transfer of ownership.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two factors, the database, and the transfer of ownership, can be implemented using the blockchain based
technologies called Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Bitcoin is digital cash, but can be seen as the transfer of value between users.
  Ethereum could also be seen as a transfer of value but it's main function is what's called a smart contract.  Both store
transactions in a database, but unlike the centralised database of the Land Registry both use a distributed database.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns about the blockchain is the removal of intermediaries.  This proposal suggests a measured
transistion, one record at a time, not a mass migratation.  In the fashion that the Land Registry has taken in the past to
property registration.</p>
<h4>Basic suggestion for implementation</h4>
<p>The form that is used to register property, the TR1 and AP1, an application to change the register, would have another
 two fields.  One for the owner's Bitcoin
address and the other for the owner's Ethereum address.  Both are an alpha-numberic string of characters.  Both are long,
and are ideally, and really only, meant for cut and paste due to their length and the importance of what they represent.
Bitcoin addresses start with a 1 and Ethereum addresses start with an 0x.  This distinction is important, so that they
are not mixed up too.  The current Land Registry database would add two columns to include these two addresses as fields.
Each property record would then be updated when a completed AP1 form was submitted.</p> 
<p>With one of the Land Registry's Ethereum addresses it would call the relevant contract with the intention to transfer
the property to the Ethereum address of the current owner.  The Land Registry would basically put the property 'up for
sale' on the blockchain, but only the person with access to the Ethereum address that has be registered via the AP1 and
in the Land Registry database could 'buy' the property.  The owner would send the token Bitcoin or Ethereum payment to the Land
 Registry and the ownership would be transferred through the transaction.  This token amount could be set to cover 
 Land Registry costs.</p>
<p>The Land Registry's database may be distributed in one sense, but the distinction between that and a Blockchain based
distributed system is that it facilitates transactions that require no trusted 3rd party to validate them.</p>
<p>There is a testnet on Ethereum where all it's features can be tested before moving to the mainnet.</p>
<h4>What is a smart contract</h4>
<p>Register: 'an official list or record of names or items.'</p>
<p>for title transfer and storage at the Land Registry.  
There are many advantages of using Blockchain technology by the Land Registry.  The 4 main advantages when considering this proposal
are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Reducing costs;</li>
	<li>Maintain a record of property titles;</li>
	<li>Ensure the proper collection of taxes;</li>
	<li>Reduce property transaction times.</li>
</ol>
<p>The blockchain and associated technologies mentioned in this paper can help achieve these objectives.</p>  
<p>The solution to achieve these 4 main goals use two open source blockchain technologies called Bitcoin and Ethereum.  For the
purposes of this use-case Bitcoin
is used as digital cash, and Ethereum is used for smart contracts.  Both store their peer-to-peer transactions on their
blockchain, which is a distributed ledger of immutable transactions.</p>
<p>This proposal does not include how to convert fiat currency to bitcoin, or the way that the remaining
properties on your database that have not been converted are transferred to the blockchain, or the daily operations
 of the land registry.  This paper is about the transfer of property, and transactions and storage of the titles.</p>
<p>Ebay anaology for explaining how smart contracts work.  Ethereum is 'if this, then that'.</p>

<p>This essay introduces one possible method for the Land Registry using blockchain technology that would improve security of data,
reduce costs, and reduce transaction times.</p>
<p>The Land Registry:</p>
<p>The blockchain offers 
a new paradigm, a new model, of how the Land Registry could function.</p> 
<p>The technology at the Land Registry is built around the following two things:</p>
